          <h2>About</h2>
          <p class="lead"><code>printf("a lifelong hobby");</code></p>
          <p>
            I've been programming since my early teens. My first taster came
            when we got a PlayStation 2, oddly enough. It came bundled with a
            demo disc, and one of the things on it was
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yabasic">Yabasic</a>, a
            simple BASIC interpreter.
          </p>

          <p class="rounded bg-light p-3">
            Interestingly enough, these demo discs shipped only in the PAL
            region between 2000 and 2003, and included Yabasic as an attempt to
            classify the PS2 as a personal computer instead of a video game
            console, for tax reasons. Thanks to CTurt for this info, found in
            his article
            <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had a play with it, mostly just editing code that was included as
            templates, or typing in Yabasic code from PS2 magazines. I was
            hooked.
          </p>
          <p>
            As chance would have it, one of my uncles was also into software
            development, and after I showed him Yabasic he gave me a copy of a
            Visual Basic 6 book along with a copy of Microsoft Visual Basic 6
            and MSDN (both CDs). I've been learning ever since.
          </p>
          <p class="lead"><code>printf("and always a hobby");</code></p>
          <p>
            For various reasons I've never really used any of this knowledge for
            work. It has come in handy, along with my general computer
            knowledge, but I've never been employed as a developer of any kind.
          </p>
          <p>I'm hoping that will change soon.</p>
